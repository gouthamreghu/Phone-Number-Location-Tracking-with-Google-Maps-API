# Phone-Number-Location-Tracking-with-Google-Maps-API
Location tracking with a phone number using Google Maps in Python involves leveraging the Google Maps API to retrieve the real-time or historical location data of a device associated with a phone number. 

Description:

Location Tracking with Phone Number using Google Maps in Python

Main Components:

main.py: This is the main Python script that orchestrates the location tracking process.

phone.py: This script interacts with the user to input the phone number for tracking.

mylocation.html: This HTML file is generated by the Python script and contains a Google Maps link displaying the tracked location.

Workflow:

When you run main.py, it will prompt you to input the phone number you want to track.

phone.py validates the phone number format and sends a request to a location tracking service (e.g., Google Maps API) to obtain the location coordinates associated with the phone number.

Once the location data is received, main.py generates an HTML file (Mylocation.html) containing a link to Google Maps with the tracked location marked.

You can then open the map.html file in a web browser to view the tracked location on Google Maps.
